# h2serve

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/h2serve/badge/?version=latest)](https://h2serve.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

A Python HTTP/2 server.

**EXPERIMENTAL**. I'm playing around with this in my free time. I started this
because I wanted to read the HTTP/2 spec and because I was unhappy with the
other Python servers out there which have surprisingly poor documentation.

I might publish it later if I think people might find it useful.
